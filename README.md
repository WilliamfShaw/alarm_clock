### Alarm clock built using `osascript`and `ruby`

### To Run

From your command line and the root of this application `ruby app.rb`

### Approach

The application was built as an exercise for `General Assembly Web Development Immersive` students, so it purposely over modularizes everything to force them to work with modules.
